Snyder Wood Storyteller
=======================

A mashup of Blake Snyder's 15 screenwriting beats (https://timstout.wordpress.com/story-structure/blake-snyders-beat-sheet/) and Wally Wood's 22 Panels that Always work (http://www.comicbookscriptarchive.com/archive/panel-1/panel-1-wally-woods-22-panels-that-always-work/), The *Snyder Wood Storyteller* is a simple web app that lets users select a Wood Panel, relate it to a Snyder beat, and apply a caption.
